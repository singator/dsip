## Learning Outcomes

1. To familiarise with writing Dockerfiles and Docker compose YAML files.
2. To get comfortable reading about how to run images from Docker Hub.
3. To generate basic API endpoints in a Flask Application.

## Overview

The task is to get these two containers up and running:

1. A MySQL database containing information about users. The image containing 
   the database can be obtained from this [Docker Hub site](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/singator/dsa3101-2220-db/general)
1. A Flask application serving on port 5000 with 3 end points:
    * `/` to display the `users_info` table
    * `/register` to display a user-input form.
    * `/result` to display the result of clicking 'Submit' button on the user-input form.
    
Accessing through a browser, the first endpoint should be a GET request that 
displays the full table:
```{r out.width="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/org_table.png")
```

Clicking on the link at the bottom will take you to the second endpoint. This endpoint 
displays a registration form.
```{r out.width="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/register_user.png")
```

Clicking on "Submit" will trigger a POST request to the third endpoint, that
inserts rows into the database, and returns a page indicating if the database
update was successful.
```{r out.width="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/registration.png")
```

Returning to the original endpoint displays the new table:

```{r out.width="60%", echo=FALSE, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("figs/updated_table.png")
```
    

## Tasks

1. Fill up the details in the Dockerfile
2. Fill in the missing details in the docker-compose.yml file
3. Create the end-points in the users.py file
4. Create a requirements for installing the Python packages on the image.

Place the above 4 files into a zip file and submit them as your assignment.

## Notes/Hints

* All end-points return HTML pages generated from Jinja templates, which you do not 
  have to modify.
* In the Python script, you only have to add the decorators.
* Only the Flask container should be accessible to the outside world, and only through 
port 5000.  
* The database image does not need any further modification; it just needs to be 
pulled and run.
* There is no naming convention for the zip file to be submitted. If you made a 
  mistake and need to submit a new version, you can do so. We will only grade the latest one.
